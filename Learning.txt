1. Data Binding requires the data to be "Property". And don't forget to implement INotifyPropertyChanged interface for notifying the UI about property changes.
2. Make sure when working cross multiple projects with WPF, set the "xmlns:local="clr-namespace:__NamespaceForTheCurrentProject__;assembly=__NameOfTheTargetProject__"". Otherwise, it will not recognize the types from other projects.
3. Changing namespace of the project will break all the existing xmlns references in XAML files. So, be cautious while changing the namespace.

4. When the project name is changed, make sure to re-add the references to other projects as they might get broken.

5. Seems like if you bind a list to a control, and you want to change element inside the list. It is enough to call PropertyChanged?.Invoke(__nameof(TheList)__) outside the list. The element inside the list doesn't seems to need to implement that interface.
