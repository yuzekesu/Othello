1. Data Binding requires the data to be "Property". And don't forget to implement INotifyPropertyChanged interface for notifying the UI about property changes.
2. Make sure when working cross multiple projects with WPF, set the "xmlns:local="clr-namespace:__NamespaceForTheCurrentProject__;assembly=__NameOfTheTargetProject__"". Otherwise, it will not recognize the types from other projects.
3. Changing namespace of the project will break all the existing xmlns references in XAML files. So, be cautious while changing the namespace.
